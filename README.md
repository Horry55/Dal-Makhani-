How to make Dal Makhani

Step 1 Soak urad, rajma overnight & pressure cook the next day

To prepare this popular dish, soak sabut urad and rajma overnight in three cups of water.
 Drain it and pressure cook in 6 cups of water with a pinch of salt. This makes the rajma and dal soft.

Step 2 Fry the onions, green chillies & tomato puree

Take a kadhai on medium flame, then heat the oil and add the cumin seeds.Once the cumin seeds crackle, you 
can add half the ginger-garlic paste and stir for sometime. Then you can add some onions, chopped green 
chillies and tomato puree. Fry until the mix turns golden. If you are someone who loves the authentic
 style of Dal Makhani, then we suggest you to use ghee instead of sunflower oil.

Step 3 Add the rajma & dal

Once the bhuna masala is ready you can add the pressure cooked Rajma and dal, and bring to boil. If you
 want your Dal Makhani to be smooth, you can grind the masala first and then add the dal and Rajma.

Step 4 Add the garam masala & garnish with fresh cream & coriander leaves

Then add garam masala and salt as per your taste. Stir well and bring to boil, if you think that the dal
 is too thick, you can add some water. Then add some fresh cream to this recipe and stir well. This will
  make your Dal Makhani creamy and delicious. Garnish this recipe with fresh cream and freshly chopped
   coriander leaves.
